/*
A pybind object wrapper which can safely be stored statically.

Pybind has an official type with a similar purpose, `py::gil_safe_call_once_and_store`. However,
it's more suited to something which exists forever, it has a leaking destructor. This class is
better for static objects which may keep getting replaced.

The issue with py::object is it's destructor assumes Python is still running - but when stored in
static memory, it may be called after finalization. Most obviously, this means we can't grab the
GIL, so it will throw an exception during a destructor, and thus crash the game. While this only
happens when you close the game anyway, we don't want the user to see us causing crashes.
